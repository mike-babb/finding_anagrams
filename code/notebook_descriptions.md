# submatrix extraction options
The big question is if I want to keep using that damn word length in all submatrix 
extraction options. I am not sure if it really reduces that much.

# GENERAL NOTES
## 2023 12 24
So, the issue is that I have too many objects - dictionaries, mostly - that I am having a hard time keeping track of them.
I need to create a schema / list that keeps track of them all. 
I have also re-done this so many times that I have created the same object too many times. And with different names. Or, slightly different names.

# Matrix selection options
Option 1: Full matrix
Option 2: Word-length
Option 3: First letter
Option 4: Single-least common letter
Option 5: n least common letters
Option 6: word-length and n least common letters
